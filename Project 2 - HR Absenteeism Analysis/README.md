# Analysing Employee Absenteeism using Excel 

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project analyses workplace absenteeism using employee demographics, lifestyle choices and compensation data. Furthermore, the HR department is looking to promote a healthy workforce through incentive programs like a bonus. Specifically, they aim to identify healthy employees with low absenteeism for a health bonus and evaluate compensation adjustments for non-smokers.

Data was extracted and loaded using Excel Power Query Editor. Data cleaning and modelling was done using Excel Functions. Key trends and insights was visualized through a two-page Excel dashboard.

## üß† Business Problem

Employee absenteeism directly affects productivity and efficiency. The HR department wants to understand the major reasons of absenteeism and identify areas where intervention - through wellness programs and compensation changes - can reduce unplanned leave and encourage healthier employee behaviour.

## üéØ Objectives 

1. HR wants the following information for their incentive programs
   - Provide a list of healthy individuals and low absenteeism for a health bonus program.
   - Calculate wage increase for non-smokers - budget $983,221
2. Develop an Excel dashboard to help HR understand key absenteeism patterns accross time, demographics and lifestyle
   - Absenteeism Overview - Key trends, Absenteeism Distribution and top reasons for being absent 
   - Absenteeism Factors - Analysis of how compensation, disciplinary failure and social lifestyle (Smoker, Drinker, BMI and no of degrees, pets and children) impact absenteeism.

## üìñ Dataset

The dataset includes information on:
- Demographics: Age, education, BMI, children, pets
- Compensation: Compensation per hour
- Lifestyle: Smoking, drinking habits
- Absenteeism: Reasons, number of hours, days of the week, and months

The data is anonymized and provided in CSV format. The dataset has 740 records.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel - For data transformation, and dashboard design.
- Power Query Editor - To merge data and data cleaning 
- Pivot Table - To group and summarize data.
- Excel Functions - VLOOPUP, FILTER, SORT, TEXT, UNIQUE.
- Helper Sheets - To support dynamic filtering.
- Camera Tool - For embedding KPI visuals into the main dashboard.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation using Excel Power Query Editor and Excel Functions
1. Imported and merged three CSV tables into a clean dataset.
2. Removed ambiguous and low-value columns.
3. Created BMI Category and Season columns using Index + VLOOKUP.

### 2. Creation of Helper Worksheets

The following worksheets were created for efficient selection of data based on user preferences

- Dashboard Metrics - The main KPIs were created and formatted on this page. The KPIs were transported to the main dashboard using the camera tool.
- Index - Lookup helper to simplify formulas using VLOOKUP.
- Calculation Engine - Tables needed to make dashboard graphs were created in this worksheet.

### 3. Dashboard Development in Excel
The dashboard has the following main Attributes
1. Page 1 - Absenteeism Overview
   - KPI - Summary of relevent KPIs like total employees, average time absent, % of smokers/drinkers, etc
   - Time-series analysis - tracks when employees take leaves
   - Employee demographics - Determines employee body factors (BMI, age) that tend to take more leaves
   - Top reasons - table that indicates primary absent causes
  
2. Page 2 - Absenteeism Factors
   - Work factors - graphs that indicate whether disciplinary failure and compensation/hr are related to absenteeism
   - Social factors - Provide insights into what social factors affect absenteeism
   - Health factors - Column charts that indicade whether BMI or smoker/drinker affect absenteeism 

## üèÜ Final Insights

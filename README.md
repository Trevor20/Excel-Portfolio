Here is the overview of the projects:

1. [CRM Sales analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/Excel-Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20CRM%20Sales%20Analysis) - This project provides a comprehensive analysis on sales performance, pipeline status and closed deals of sales representatives. The final dashboard tracks key metrics like total deals, closed deals, win rates and deal stages to provide data driven desision making.

2. [HR Absenteeism analysis](https://github.com/Trevor20/Excel-Portfolio/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20HR%20Absenteeism%20Analysis) - This project explores patterns and factors that contribute to absenteeism in the workplace. The fictitious HR also wanted to reward employees with healthy lifestyle to promote healthy living. Data extraction and load was done using Power Query Editor. Data cleaning and modelling was done with Excel Functions and Helper columns. The data was visualized through dashboards in Excel.
